    <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The issue that will be examined in this research project is homelessness amongst LGBTQ+ individuals. This project should hopefully reveal the ratio of homeless people who are LGBTQ+ and explore the reasons for which these individuals have become homeless. This exploration will be useful to the general study of LGBTQ+ rights and equality by examining the ways in which they are systematically disadvantaged and otherwise failed by the capitalist system established by our society.
