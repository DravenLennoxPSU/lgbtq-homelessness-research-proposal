    <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>The issue that will be examined in this research project is homelessness amongst LGBTQ+ individuals. This project should hopefully reveal the ratio of homeless people who are LGBTQ+ and explore the reasons for which these individuals have become homeless. This exploration will be useful to the general study of LGBTQ+ rights and equality by examining the ways in which they are systematically disadvantaged and otherwise failed by the capitalist system established by our society.</p>
    
    <h2>II. Background/Review of Literature</h2>
    
    <p>In the study of LGBTQ+ rights and homelessness, several facets have already been covered. This includes the study of issues facing those at the intersection of LGBTQ+ identities, the elderly, and people of color; the protection of LGBTQ+ youth and their healthcare; the sexual risk faced by homeless individuals and LGBTQ+ individuals of high school age in Los Angeles; the causes of homelessness and paths out of homelessness for people with diverse gender identities; the incidence of sexual and gender minorities within foster homes and orphanages; the differences in education experiences of LGBTQ+ youth and their cisgender, heterosexual peers; and the effects of media intervention on an individual’s attitude towards transgender individuals. (Seon 2017, Hein et al. 2018, Rice et al. 2013, Edward and Brown 2020, Wilson and Kastanis 2015, Zook 2016, Tarucuk and Koch 2021). It is also known that 5.6% of adults identify as LGBTQ+, and 1 in 6 adults born since 1997 identify as LGBTQ+. (Jones 2021). This literature, however, does leave several important questions unanswered. While homelessness in the transgender community has been examined, homelessness in the LGBTQ+ community at large has not been examined. As such, this study will explore the homelessness among the LGBTQ community under the age of 25.</p>
    
    <h2>III. Rationale</h2>
    
    <p>This study will ask how LGBTQ+ individuals became homeless. I hypothesize that common responses will include a lack of acceptance from family as homophobia and transphobia are unfortunately rampant in the United States, and struggles with securing jobs as capitalism tends to devalue anyone who isn’t a white cisgender, heterosexual man. If this hypothesis is confirmed, it will reveal that hatred from elder generations and discrimination from capitalism are actively endangering people and need to be addressed to protect present and future generations. If this hypothesis is disproven, this study should still reveal issues that need to be addressed to protect present and future generations.</p>
    
    <h2>IV. Method and Design</h2>
    
    <p>This study will be conducted through surveys and interviews of participants. This way the ratio of homeless LGBTQ+ individuals can be compared to the ratio of overall LGBTQ+ individuals. Further, it will allow for the stories of these LGBTQ+ individuals to be shared and examined. The survey would be provided to the homeless population under 25 years of age. The people determined to be members of the LGBTQ+ community from this survey would then be interviewed to learn their stories and their significance to this study, and their cisgender heterosexual counterparts would be interviewed such that their stories may be compared and contrasted.</p>
    
    <h2>V. Significance and Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p>This study would be important because it would reveal and highlight the underlying issues in our society that disproportionately disadvantage the LGBTQ+ community. In so doing, it would open the doors to tackling and resolving those issues for the purpose of building a more equitable world.</p>
