      <h2>Significance and Conclusion</h2>
    
      <p>This study would be important because it would reveal and highlight the underlying issues in our society that disproportionately disadvantage the LGBTQ+ community. In so doing, it would open the doors to tackling and resolving those issues for the purpose of building a more equitable world.</p>
